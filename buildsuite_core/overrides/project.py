"""Project naming override.

The Frappe record `name` for a Project is controlled by the BuildSuite Core
Settings "Project Naming" select (the mode):

  - "Project ID"  -> the name IS the entered Project ID (custom_project_id). The
                     field is already required + unique, so the id doubles as the
                     record key.
  - "Name Series" -> the name is generated from the naming series chosen on the New
                     Project form (the project's own `naming_series` field), falling
                     back to the Project doctype's default series.

ERPNext's Project has no autoname() of its own (it relies on the naming_series
autoname rule), so defining one here takes precedence via override_doctype_class.
