"""Seed the per-workspace report-style shortcut tiles (Workspace Setting Single).

Seeds each live workspace's `reports` rows: Site Execution, Subcontract and Procurement.
Idempotent per workspace — a workspace that already has rows is left untouched (respects
admin edits).

Billing and Collection, Subcontractor Position and Material Status are standard Script Reports
(buildsuite_core/report/<slug>/) synced from files — crash-safe on the empty-filter run Frappe
fires on page load (a Query Report's %(x)s substitution would blow up there), and able to return
summary cards. Their roles and filters live in each report's own definition; this module only
drives the workspace tile. Delay Analysis is a bespoke in-app view, tiled as a plain route."""
