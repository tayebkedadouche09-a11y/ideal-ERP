"""Billing and Collection — one row per client invoice on a project (raised, received,
outstanding, days overdue), with Invoiced / Received / Overdue / Retention held summary
cards. Matches the prototype's per-invoice view rather than a single cumulative total.

A Script Report so the filters bind only when present (Frappe runs with empty filters on
page load; a Query Report's %(x)s would crash). Project is required; the date range is
optional and applied only when supplied.

Retention withheld by the client isn't modelled on the invoice yet — the retention_amount
field exists only on subcontractor bills (what we withhold from subcontractors, a different
figure). Reported as "—" rather than a zero that would read as "the client withholds nothing"."""
