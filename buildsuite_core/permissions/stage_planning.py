"""Record-level access for the Stage Planning doctype.

Stage Planning inherits the parent Project's team scoping. CRUD own-scope:
  - Site Engineer / Foreman: edit/delete only their OWN-created stages, and only
    while the stage is still editable (Draft / Rejected — not after submit).
Full roles (Director, PM, BS-Admin, System Manager) have full CRUD within visible
projects. The Submit/Approve/Reject/Revise actions are governed by the Stage
Planning Approval workflow (see setup_stage_planning_workflow), not DocPerm.
