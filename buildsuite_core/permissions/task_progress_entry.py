"""Record-level access for the Task Progress Entry doctype.

A progress entry inherits the team scoping of the project behind its `task`
(Task Progress Entry has no `project` field — it links to a Task). Procurement
Officer and Store Keeper have no DocPerm at all (hidden).

Own-scope for Site Engineer / Foreman:
  - edit (write): only their OWN-created entries (owner), any time
  - delete: only their OWN-created entries, and only within 24h of creation
Full-write roles (Director, PM, BS-Admin, System Manager) bypass the own-scope.
