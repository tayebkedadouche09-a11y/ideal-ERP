"""Backend for the SPA command palette (⌘K).

RECORDS reuse the SAME permission-safe search the Desk omnibar uses —
`frappe.utils.global_search.search` (the `__global_search` full-text index), which filters to the
doctypes the user can read AND per-document `has_permission()`. So the palette can never read a
record out of a doctype the user can't open.

DOCTYPES let a query name a doctype ("journal entry") and jump to its records via the generic
records browser (/records/<doctype>) — the universal fallback for any doctype the SPA has no
bespoke view for. Both are permission-gated; the frontend routes an app doctype's record to its
bespoke view and anything else to the generic view.
