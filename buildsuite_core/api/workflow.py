"""Generic Frappe-Workflow bridge for the Vue app.

The finance documents (Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, Subcontractor Bill) ship with a
plain docstatus lifecycle: the detail views drive Submit / Cancel directly. If a site
later configures an *active* Frappe Workflow for one of those doctypes, the UI should
defer to the workflow instead — showing exactly the transitions the signed-in user may
take from the document's current state, and applying them through Frappe's engine.

This module is the seam. It exposes two thin, doctype-agnostic endpoints:

  · get_workflow_info(doctype[, name]) — is an active workflow configured, and (given a
    doc) what state is it in + which transitions can THIS user take. Frappe already filters
    transitions by the user's roles and each transition's condition, so persona-derived
    roles (see utils/user.sync_persona_roles) gate the buttons natively — no persona field
    on Workflow is needed.
  · apply_action(doctype, name, action) — run one workflow action via Frappe, return the
    resulting lifecycle snapshot.

When no workflow is configured, get_workflow_info reports active=False and callers keep
their existing docstatus buttons; nothing else changes.
