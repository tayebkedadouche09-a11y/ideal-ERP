"""Permission-matrix tests — persona role sync (what happens when a user's persona
changes) and per-persona report access, encoded from the Dashboard/Report access
sheets.

Two dimensions are covered here:

* **Persona role sync** (``TestPersonaRoleSync``) — creating a user with a persona,
  and *switching* a user's persona, must leave exactly the right BuildSuite roles.
  This is where the reported "System Manager carried over after switching persona"
  bug lives.

* **Report access** (``TestReportAccessMatrix``) — the six role-gated Script Reports
  must be runnable by exactly the personas the access sheet says, and no others.

Dashboard / workspace visibility is intentionally NOT tested here: it is enforced
entirely client-side (``frontend/src/data/roles.js`` ``WORKSPACE_VISIBILITY``), so
there is nothing on the Python backend to assert. See the module docstring note.
