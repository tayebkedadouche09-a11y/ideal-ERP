"""Keep a User's BuildSuite roles in sync with their Persona.

Persona is a Link to the Persona master, whose `roles` child table lists the roles
a user with that persona should hold. We run on `validate` (which fires on both
insert and update) and mutate `doc.roles` in place — that saves atomically with the
user and avoids the recursive-save trap that `add_roles`/`remove_roles` (which save
the doc themselves) would cause.

The sync is **additive**: setting a persona GRANTS its roles, but roles that were
added on top of a persona — whether native or BuildSuite-custom — are always kept.
A user with combined responsibilities (e.g. a PM who is also a Site Engineer) is a
legitimate flow, so manual additions must never be silently reverted.

The only roles ever removed are the ones the *previous* persona granted that the
new persona no longer grants, and only when the persona actually CHANGES — so
switching persona doesn't leave the old persona's roles piled on, while a plain
save (persona unchanged) strips nothing. A role a persona GRANTS is stripped when
you leave that persona even if it is System Manager (the "System Manager (Admin)"
persona grants it) — otherwise switching an admin down to a field persona would
silently leave platform-admin rights behind. Only two things are always kept: the
Frappe-internal roles (Administrator, All, Guest), and any role added MANUALLY on
top of a persona (a manual add is never in the previous persona's grant set, so it
is never eligible for stripping).

Delete needs no handler: Frappe cascades the Has Role child rows when the User is
deleted.

# MANUALLY on top of a field persona still survives (only the previous persona's own grants are
