"""Mirror read to child tables on existing sites.

Custom DocPerms override standard perms, so a BuildSuite role granted read on a parent doctype
gets nothing on that parent's child (Table) doctypes — a list/detail view that fetches child
rows directly then 403s (e.g. HR Manager on Crew Member). setup_child_table_read_access() runs
on install; this applies the same grant to already-migrated sites."""
