"""Backend permission anchors for the bespoke (custom-UI) reports.

Most reports are Frappe `Report` records, so their workspace tile is already role-gated by
`Report.is_permitted()`. The Project Finance, Procurement and Workforce reports (plus Delay
Analysis) are rendered by custom Vue components and were seeded as plain `route` tiles — which
bypassed permission entirely (any user who could open the workspace saw the tile and could
deep-link the route).

This module gives each of those a real `Report` record whose `roles` gate access, WITHOUT
changing how the frontend renders them: the workspace tile keeps its custom `route`, but
`workspace_setting._resolve` now hides it unless the anchor's `Report.is_permitted()` passes
(via ROUTE_TO_REPORT), and the SPA route guard denies a deep-link the same way
(api.permission.get_access_context exposes the permitted routes). So access is driven entirely by
the backend Report — no role, no tile, no route.

Anchors are Query Reports with roles but no query (the Vue component draws the UI; Frappe never
runs them). Seeded create-if-missing so an admin's later role edits survive migrate.
