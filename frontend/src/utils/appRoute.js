// base (router/index.js), the session route base + login redirect (session.js),
// and the dev-boot method path (main.js). Change this ONE token and the entire
// frontend follows.
//
// The backend route lives in buildsuite_core/hooks.py (`APP_ROUTE`) + the
// www/<route>.{py,html} page. Keep both sides in sync — the
// `bench change-app-route <new>` command rewrites this token AND the backend
// (hooks constant, www file rename) in one shot.

// tracks the route name (e.g. buildsuite_core.www.client.get_context_for_dev).
