// Companies — CLAUDE.md §14 (locked Company segregation decision).
//
// Static fixture. Pattern intentionally mirrors src/data/roles.js — each company
// has id / name / shortName / description / color (Tailwind badge class for the
// switcher pill and any future per-company indicators). To add a company, edit
// this file. There is NO admin UI for company management in the prototype, and
// per §14.6 the only multi-company affordance is the topbar switcher.
//
// Production note: in Frappe these would be Company DocType records. The id
// shape here ('ACME-COM' / 'ACME-INF' / 'ACME-RES') is short for the prototype;
// production company IDs are typically the company name itself per Frappe's
// naming convention (e.g., "Acme Commercial Pvt Ltd").
