// Command-palette search model (⌘K). Two kinds of answer, like the prototype (S363):
//   · PLACES  — where to GO: a doctype's list, or a report. Client-side + permission-gated.
//   · RECORDS — the documents themselves. Fetched from the permission-safe Frappe global-search
//               index via searchApi.searchRecords; this module only maps a result's doctype to its
//               SPA detail route + a label/icon (DOCTYPE_META).
//
// Permission is the whole point: a place a role can't open must not appear, and records are gated
// server-side by the same read permission that hides their list. So a query never leaks a record
// out of a doctype the user can't open.

// doctype -> how a record result is shown + where it opens. Mirror the backend SEARCHABLE_DOCTYPES
// (api/search.py); every entry here has a real SPA detail route.
