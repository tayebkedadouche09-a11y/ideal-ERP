/**
 * Workflow-awareness for a doctype's detail view.
 *
 * When an active Frappe Workflow governs `doctype`, `active` becomes true and
 * `transitions` holds the actions the signed-in user may take from the doc's current
 * state — Frappe filters these by the user's roles (which personas grant, see
 * utils/user.sync_persona_roles) and each transition's condition, so the buttons
 * are already permission-correct. When no workflow is configured, `active` stays
 * false and the caller keeps its existing docstatus (Submit / Cancel) buttons.
 *
 * Refs are returned individually so callers destructure them (`const { active } =
 * useWorkflow(...)`) and get template auto-unwrapping.
 *
 * @param {string} doctype
